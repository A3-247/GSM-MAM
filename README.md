This code is divided into two stages: pre-training and fine-tuning, based on the graph structure and multi-layer attention AD multi-classification auxiliary diagnosis model, the current public code is the core code part, and will be encapsulated into a system for disclosure in the future.

The results of the division of the brain network are shown in ROI.xlsx,1-8 represent DefaultMode, SensoriMotor, Visual, Salience, DorsalAttention, FrontoParietal, Language, and Cerebellar brain networks, respectively

The reported results and the results in the comparison experiments are the best results for the parameters in the model state

Contribution summary:Graph structure modeling is based on the neural transmission process induced by functional connections, introducing intermediate nodes to update edges. By constraining the total amount of information transmitted through intermediate nodes and reducing the number of parameters, updates are only made when the original connection situation can be enhanced after passing through intermediate nodes, making it closer to the real situation while avoiding the introduction of redundant information. It reflects the process of continuously learning to find the optimal transmission path when brain signals are transmitted. Update the structural information stored in the vertices based on changes in brain results due to new topological features from edge adjustments, combining them to better represent the brain structure. The Multi-layer attention mechanism combined with pathological mechanism comprehensively updates hyperparameters in the graph from three levels: individual, regional, and global. Combined with graph structure modeling, it obtains more interpretable results and weights the features reasonably.
